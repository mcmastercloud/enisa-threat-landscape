# Introduction

This Repo contains a MindMap diagram, which has been derived from the ENISA diagram which can be found here: [Original Enisa Diagram](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/enisa-thematic-landscapes/threat-landscape-of-the-internet-infrastructure/detailed-mind-map-for-internet-infrastructure-assets)

The following changes have been made:

1. Some corrections to the spelling of acronyms on the original MindMap (i.e. FFTC -> FTTC, etc.)
2. Hyperlinks addeds for acronyms you may not be familiar with (works in the PDF version, and also from Xmind, but not on the Freemind Version).

The mind-map was created using [XMind](https://xmind.app/), and the .PDF was exported from that format.  However, I have also provided a [Freemind](https://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) for those using that Open Source mind-mapping tool.

# Intent

The sole intent of this Repo is to make the MindMap more accessible, and to allow users to make edits to the Diagrams as they wish, and to reflect their particular organisations
